# 🌾 Crop Recommendation Using ANN

> Predict the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and environmental conditions using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a machine learning solution for recommending the best crop to grow based on key soil and climate parameters. It utilizes an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built using **TensorFlow/Keras** for multi-class classification on the **Crop Recommendation Dataset**.
